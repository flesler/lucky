Your luck is 8% above average
```

Include the data behind that luck
```bash
$ lucky -o 2 -r 100 -v 2
You won 32 out of 100 rounds against 2 opponent(s)
Your luck is 4% below average
```

Include the winner of each round
```bash
$ lucky -r 5 -v 3
Round 1
-> The winner is CPU 1
Round 2
-> The winner is Human
Round 3
-> The winner is CPU 1
Round 4
-> The winner is CPU 1
Round 5
-> The winner is CPU 1
You won 1 out of 5 rounds against 1 opponent(s)
Your luck is 60% below average
```

Include the score of each player on each round
```bash
$ lucky -r 3 -v
Round 1
-> Human scored: 111
-> CPU 1 scored: 166
-> The winner is CPU 1
Round 2
-> Human scored: 143
-> CPU 1 scored: 112
-> The winner is Human
Round 3
-> Human scored: 178
-> CPU 1 scored: 127

Your luck is 33% above average
```

Execute different commands depending on whether luck is above average or not
```bash
$ lucky -s && echo "Buy a lottery ticket" || echo "Go watch TV"
Go watch TV
```

Pretend to be a Magic 8-ball
```bash
$ lucky -8
Definitely!
$ lucky -8
Nope
```

Log you luck, add it to a cron and then you can make charts and whatnot
```bash
$ echo `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` `lucky -n`% >> ~/luck.log
```

## How does it measure my luck?

It simulates a match against opponents and compares your win-rate against the expected average.
